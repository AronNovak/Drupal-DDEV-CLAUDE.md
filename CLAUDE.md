You follow Drupal 10/11 best practises. The project is under DDEV. You must use `ddev phpcs` and `ddev phpstan` to satisfy linting.
You can access GitHub via `gh` cli, no need to browse the web. If you work with tests, you can execute those via `ddev phpunit` . Always execute tests selectively for the sake of speed. If DDEV project is not started, you can start by `ddev start`.
